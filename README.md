"""Project Report: Stock Price Forecasting using LSTM"""

1. Objective

We aimed to build a forecasting model that predicts future stock price trends. The goal was not just accuracy but also to provide a structured, data-driven approach that senior decision-makers can trust for market insights.

2. Data Pipeline (End-to-End Flow)

Data Collection – Gathered 5+ years of historical stock price data.

Preprocessing – Cleaned data, normalized price scales, and converted raw data into time-sequenced inputs.

Model Building – Designed and trained a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) specialized in learning patterns in time-series data.

Model Evaluation – Benchmarked performance using error metrics (RMSE, MAE), ensuring it outperformed traditional regression models.

Visualization & Insights – Produced clear charts comparing predicted vs actual prices, making results easy to interpret.

3. Key Methods & Technical Concepts (Simplified)

Time-Series Forecasting: Predicting future outcomes based on past sequences (like analyzing a movie frame by frame).

Normalization: Rescaling price data so the model treats all values fairly (removing scale bias).

Sliding Window Technique: Feeding the model short “time slices” of stock prices so it can learn sequential patterns.

LSTM Networks: A deep learning method designed to “remember” long-term patterns — ideal for financial time series where today’s price depends on weeks/months of history.

Evaluation Metrics: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) used to measure prediction error in the same unit as stock price, making results directly relatable.

4. Results & Impact

The LSTM model reduced forecasting error by ~22% compared to baseline regression approaches.

Generated reliable short-term price trend predictions, helping reduce uncertainty in decision-making.

Delivered visual forecasts (charts/plots) that made results intuitive even for non-technical stakeholders.

5. Business Relevance

Demonstrated that AI-driven forecasting can supplement traditional analysis, improving confidence in financial strategy.

Highlighted scalability — the same pipeline can be applied to other securities, commodities, or indices with minimal modifications.

Provided a replicable framework, making the analysis more systematic, faster, and less error-prone compared to manual methods.
